    <section>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>BackRecorder</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the mobile application.
            This document explains what data is collected, where data is stored, and how the user can control or delete data.
        </p>

        <div class="note" role="note">
            <strong>Key summary:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not collect or store your personal data on any server controlled by the author.</li>
                <li>Audio files are recorded locally on your device by default.</li>
                <li>If you enable cloud integration (for example, Google Drive), audio files are uploaded only to <em>your</em> cloud account and are not routed through or retained on any server operated by the app author.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Data collected by the app</h2>
    <p>
        BackRecorder is designed to operate locally. By default the application records audio to files stored on the device’s storage.
        The app does not automatically transmit recorded audio or user information to any servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Cloud integration and uploads</h2>
    <p>
        Cloud upload functionality (for example: Google Drive integration) is strictly optional and must be explicitly enabled by you.
        When cloud integration is enabled:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The app obtains an access token from the cloud provider in order to upload files directly to your cloud account.</li>
        <li>Audio files that you choose to save are uploaded to your cloud storage account. The destination folder is in your account and managed by you.</li>
        <li>No copies of your audio files are stored on servers controlled by the author or developer unless you explicitly decide to share them elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. What the author does NOT do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or aggregate recordings or user files on any author-controlled backend.</li>
        <li>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise monetize your recordings.</li>
        <li>We do not use your recordings for analytics, machine learning, or similar processing on author servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        If you enable cloud upload, third-party services (for example Google Drive) will be involved when you upload files. Those services are governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.
        We recommend reviewing the provider’s privacy policy to understand how they process and store your data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security and storage</h2>
    <p>
        Audio files are stored on the device file system. You can manage or delete these files using the app or your file manager.
        When uploading to your cloud account, files are transmitted using the transport mechanisms provided by the cloud provider. The app attempts to follow best practices for secure transmission, but ultimate security guarantees are provided by the cloud provider.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over recordings and cloud behavior:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may enable or disable cloud uploads at any time in the app.</li>
        <li>You may delete audio files stored locally using any file manager.</li>
        <li>If you uploaded files to your cloud account, you can remove them from your cloud provider’s interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Legal responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        Recording another person’s conversations or the surrounding environment may be illegal in some jurisdictions.
        It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations where you use the app.
        The author of this application assumes no liability for any illegal, negligent, or improper use of the app.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
        Saved files remain locally on the device until you manually delete them.
        Saved files uploaded to your cloud storage remain there until you delete them via your cloud provider.
        <br/>
        Temporary files remain locally on the device until you manually delete them or the app deletes them according to its retention settings.
        Temporary files uploaded to your cloud storage remain there until you delete them via your cloud provider or the app deletes them according to its retention settings.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>
        The app is not directed to children. If you are under the minimum age required by law in your jurisdiction, do not use this app.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page will change to reflect the effective date of any update.
        Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>

                This Privacy Policy applies only to the BackRecorder mobile application and not to any third-party services you choose to use (for example, Google Drive). Always review the privacy terms of third-party cloud providers before enabling integration.
